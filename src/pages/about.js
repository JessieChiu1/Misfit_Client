                <Title1>Why I Started Misfit!</Title1>
                <Text size={500}>As someone who grew up dressing masculine but has a tiny body, it has always been a struggle to find the right fit for me. Clothing and apparel companies just don't cater to our needs. Most of us have a hard time finding the perfect clothes or brand for us. The problem only compounded while I was in college. I was a Finance Major and was in desperate need to find the right fit for everything from suits to shoes to even ties (They are too long for me). I ended up shelling out money for made-to-measure suits just so I could get something to wear for work. I even resorted to buying from the boy's section (Apparently, I am size boy 14), but then you run into issues with quality and style.</Text>
                <br/>
                <Text size={500}>I know finding clothes is even harder for others in the transgender community. Nonetheless, some of you are fashion magicians and can make it work. I am starting this website so we have a place in the community to discover brands or styles that work for us!</Text>
